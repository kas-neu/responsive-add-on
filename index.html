            <h2>Why scuba?</h2>
            <h3>Scuba diving, the gate to underwater world</h3>
            <p>
              We seem to increasingly live in a world that is dominated by
              social media. A world in which everyone portrays their ‘best
              life.’ Where Photoshop, image enhancement apps, background
              removers, and filters rule as King. Do you ever wonder where the
              line is between real and fake, or fake and too fake, or whatever
              happened to natural beauty? If this sounds all too familiar to
              you, the underwater world could be your dream getaway.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scuba diving is one of the only sports or hobbies where we are all
              on a level playing field. There are no filters, apps, or fakery
              when you get underwater. When you immerse yourself beneath the
              surface, what you see around you is real – and you are right there
              in the moment.

                  Bajo Alcyone – Cocos Island, Costa Rica
                </h4>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Cocos Island, which lies far from the Costa Rican Pacific
                  coast, is only accessible by liveaboard but is consistently
                  ranked as the top destination in the world for hammerhead
                  diving with this first-class dive site. The seamount known as
                  Bajo Alcyone rises to 82 feet (25 meters) below the surface
                  and is regularly home to large shoals of hammerhead sharks.
                  The diving can be tricky, but the plan is simple. Divers
                  descend to the top of the seamount, wedge themselves between
                  the rocks, and watch the action above. This is truly an epic
                  site and worthy of a place on every “best dive sites” list!

                </h4>
                <p class="text-center">
                  One of the best wreck dives in the world (and probably one of
                  the most famous dive sites), the SS Thistlegorm lies in the
                  northern section of the Red Sea. As a popular day trip and
                  liveaboard stop, it’s easily accessible from Sharm El-Sheikh.
                  The wreck itself was previously a 420-foot (128-meter) British
                  transport ship. Unfortunately, she met her fate in 1941 when
                  she was sunk by a German air attack. Today, she remains a
                  window into history with a visible cargo of trucks, jeeps,
                  motorcycles, tanks, and even a locomotive.

                  Blue Corner – Ngemelis Island, Palau
                </h4>
                <p class="text-center">
                  Blue Corner is a dive for the ages. It consists of a
                  reef-covered wall that runs along the side of Ngemelis Island
                  in Palau. While the dive is great at any time due to the
                  massive schools of fish, this drift-diving site shows its best
                  face when the currents are strong (think more current, more
                  fish – it’s never been more apt). Divers use reef hooks to
                  carefully attach to the wall and watch a number of pelagic
                  species swim past. Common sights include tuna, sharks, and
                  eagle rays. This is undoubtedly some of the best reef diving
                  in the world, and many Blue Corner alumni claim that they have
                  never seen so many sharks on a single dive.
